# According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? 

According to Fisher’s Model of Reflective Listening the key points are based on slowing down the conversation, understanding the message, 
and feeding it back to the speaker without judgment.

1. Listening for Content
2. Listening for Feelings
3. Reflecting Back
4. Validating the Speaker
5. Avoiding Judgment and Advice
6. Focusing on the Speaker, Not Yourself

Essence of Fisher’s Reflective Listening -> “Understand first, don’t assume, reflect back without judgment.”

# What are the obstacles in your listening process?

One major obstacle is that I sometimes think about my response while the other person is still speaking. Instead of fully paying attention to their complete message, my mind jumps ahead to how I am going to answer. 
Because of this, I may miss some details or misunderstand their point. I have realized that this happens especially during discussions or debates where I feel the need to justify myself.

Another obstacle is forming judgments too quickly. If I disagree with a point or have a different opinion, I sometimes begin evaluating or criticizing the message internally instead of listening openly. 
This creates a mental barrier and prevents me from understanding the speaker’s intention clearly.

# What can you do to improve your listening?

Improving my listening skills is important to me because effective listening helps in building stronger relationships, reducing misunderstandings, and improving communication overall. 
I have identified several practical steps that I can take to become a better and more attentive listener.

-> First, I can work on being fully present in conversations. This means giving the speaker my complete attention and avoiding multitasking. To do this, 
I will consciously remove or silence distractions like my phone, notifications, or unnecessary thoughts so that I can focus completely on what the other person is saying.

-> Second, I can practice patience and allow the speaker to finish without interrupting. Sometimes I feel tempted to complete their sentences or jump directly to giving advice, but I understand that this can make the speaker feel unheard. 
I will remind myself to listen completely before responding and give the other person enough time to express themselves in their own way.

# When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

Although I generally try to communicate assertively, there are some situations in my day-to-day life where I notice myself shifting into a passive communication style. 
This usually happens when I feel uncomfortable expressing my needs or when I am worried that my opinion might create conflict or hurt someone’s feelings.

One situation where I switch to passive communication is when I am around people who are very dominant or outspoken. If someone speaks very confidently or forcefully, I sometimes hold back my thoughts even when I have something valuable to contribute. 
I choose silence instead of sharing my perspective because I don’t want to create disagreement or appear argumentative.

Another instance is when I care about a person’s emotions more than my own preference. For example, if a friend or family member suggests something that I don’t fully agree with—like a place to eat or a plan for the day—I often just go along with it. 
I do this to maintain harmony and make others feel happy, even if my own choice is different.

# When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

I actively try to communicate respectfully and maintain calm interactions, there are certain situations in my everyday life where I notice myself shifting into an aggressive communication style. This usually happens when strong emotions take over, 
especially frustration, impatience, or a feeling of being unheard.

One situation where I tend to become aggressive is when I feel that I am being ignored or not taken seriously. If I try multiple times to express my thoughts and someone continues to interrupt or dismiss what I am saying, I sometimes raise my voice or speak in a forceful manner. 
At that moment, my main focus shifts from communicating clearly to making sure I am heard, even if it causes tension.

I also notice aggression when I am under stress or pressure. For example, if I am already overwhelmed with tasks and someone asks for help or points out a mistake, I may react more sharply than necessary. Instead of responding calmly, I may sound irritated or annoyed, 
even if the person did not intend to upset me.

# When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

Even though I try to communicate openly and respectfully, there are certain situations where I notice myself shifting into a passive-aggressive communication style. Passive-aggressive behavior usually happens when I don’t express my feelings openly, 
but my frustration or disappointment comes out indirectly through sarcasm, silence, taunts, or other subtle behaviors.

One of the most common moments when I become passive-aggressive is when I feel hurt or angry but don’t feel comfortable expressing it directly. Instead of saying how I feel, I sometimes withdraw, give short responses, or use silent treatment. 
I convince myself that “it’s not worth talking about,” even though the problem still bothers me internally.

I also notice passive-aggressiveness when my efforts or contributions are not acknowledged or appreciated. If I worked hard on something and someone ignores it or takes it for granted, I may become distant or start responding with sarcasm like, “Sure, as usual, no one cares.” 
I do this because I want the other person to realize my hurt without me having to say it directly.

# How can you make your communication assertive? what would be a few steps I can apply in your own life?

Assertive communication means expressing your thoughts, feelings, and needs clearly, honestly, and respectfully, without being passive, aggressive, or passive-aggressive. It is a balance between standing up for yourself and respecting others.

#I can make my communication more assertive by following these steps:
1. Be Clear About Your Needs and Feelings
Before speaking, I can take a moment to identify what I really want to communicate. This means being aware of my own feelings and needs and focusing on expressing them without blaming others.

2. Use “I” Statements
Instead of saying “You never listen to me,” which sounds accusatory, I can use statements like:

“I feel unheard when I am interrupted, and I would appreciate it if I could finish my point.”
This reduces defensiveness and makes my message clear and personal.

3. Maintain Calm and Respectful Tone
Assertive communication is about firmness without aggression. I can control my voice tone, avoid shouting, and keep body language open (eye contact, upright posture, relaxed gestures) to show confidence without intimidating others.

4. Practice and Self-Reflection
I can improve assertiveness over time by reflecting on my interactions, noticing when I was passive or aggressive, and thinking about how I could respond more clearly next time. Role-playing or practicing with friends/family also helps.

5. Be Confident but Open to Feedback
Assertiveness involves confidence in expressing your ideas, while also staying open to other people’s input. I can share my perspective, and simultaneously show willingness to listen and collaborate.
