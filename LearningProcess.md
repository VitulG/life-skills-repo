# What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is learning by explaining a concept in the simplest possible way, as if you’re teaching it to a five year old.

# What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In Barbara Oakley’s TEDx talk “Learning How to Learn”, the most interesting and powerful idea for me:

The brain learns better when we switch between focused mode and diffuse mode She explains this through a story from her own life —
as a student she was terrible at math, assumed she wasn’t “smart enough,” and avoided it. But later, when she learned how the brain’s focused mode (deep concentration) and 
diffuse mode (relaxed, wandering mind) work together, she changed her learning style:

1. Short focused study then break (relaxation, walk, sleep)
2. Brain forms connections subconsciously (understanding becomes clearer)

# What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

1. Active (Focused) Mode 
	When you concentrate intensely on a problem or a topic.
	Brain uses logical and analytical thinking.
	It Works best for solving familiar problems.
	
2. Diffused Mode
	When the brain is relaxed and not actively focusing.
	Thoughts wander and connect ideas subconsciously.
	It helps in understanding concepts creatively and forming new insights.
	
# What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

1. Break the skill down into smaller sub-skills.
2. Learn enough to self-correct (just-in-time learning).
3. Remove barriers that prevent practice.
4. Practice for at least 20 hours.

# What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

1. Use Focused Mode and Diffused Mode :-
		Our brain has two learning states:
			Focused mode :- deep concentration
			Diffused mode :- relaxed mind that makes unconscious connections

2. Break down the skill into sub-skills :- Big skills are overwhelming. Learning becomes easy when you learn one component at a time.
3. Deliberate practice :- Most learners repeat what they already know and this feels good but doesn’t grow skill.
4. Remove distractions to increase learning power :- Our brain cannot do deep learning with interruptions.
5. Test yourself instead of re-reading :- Re-reading feels productive but does not build memory.
