# In this video, the most interesting story or idea for me is?

“Forget big change, start with a tiny habit” is the story of how he built the habit of doing two push-ups after every trip to the bathroom at home.
Not because he wanted to become super fit or make a huge transformation but because he wanted to prove that:
Tiny habits, when linked to an existing routine, are easier to start, easier to repeat, and eventually lead to big results.

This example demonstrated three powerful ideas in the video:

1. Make the habit extremely small (only 2 push-ups, not 50)
2. Attach it to an existing daily anchor (after using the bathroom)
3. Celebrate immediately (say “I’m awesome!” to reinforce feeling of success)

Don’t wait for motivation or big discipline design a tiny habit, attach it to something you already do, and let momentum grow.

# How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

BJ Fogg’s Tiny Habits framework explains that a behavior happens only when three things come together at the same time:
M -> Motivation
A -> Ability
P -> Prompt

1. Motivation

How much you want to do the behavior.
Motivation goes up and down, so relying on motivation alone never creates long-term habits.

2. Ability

How easy the behavior is to do.
If something is too difficult, you won’t do it consistently no matter how motivated you are.
Making habits tiny increases ability.

3. Prompt

The reminder or cue that tells you to do the behavior.
The best prompts are not alarms or apps — but events already in your routine

# Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

Celebrating (“Shining”) after completing a tiny habit is extremely important because it trains your brain to love the habit and that’s what makes the habit stick.

Why it matters :-
1. Celebration creates a positive emotion.
2. Emotion wires habits faster than repetition.
3. Celebration makes motivation unnecessary.
4. It builds identity, not just action.
5. It creates momentum.

# In this 1% Better Every Day video, what was the most interesting story or idea for me?

One of the most interesting and memorable ideas from James Clear’s talk “1% Better Every Day” is the story of how the British Cycling Team transformed from decades of failure to world champions 
by focusing on tiny 1% improvements in hundreds of small areas not big changes.

Instead of trying to find one magical solution, they improved little things like:

1. bike seats
2. tires
3. hand-washing techniques
4. sleep habits
5. massage gel
6. helmet design
7. aerodynamics

why it matters the most :- You don’t need a huge overhaul small daily improvements compound into extraordinary results over time.

# What is the book's perspective about Identity?

In Atomic Habits, James Clear emphasizes identity as the foundation of lasting habit change. The perspective is simple but powerful: your habits are a reflection of your identity, and lasting change comes not from focusing solely on outcomes or behaviors, 
but on who you want to become.

1. Identity vs. Outcome vs. Process

a. Outcome -> It focuses on the results.
b. Process -> It focuses on the actions.
c. Identity -> It focuses on becoming a type of person.

2. Two-step approach to identity change

a. Decide the type of person you want to be.
b. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

3. Habits as identity reinforcement

a. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
b. Tiny behaviors accumulate over time, reinforcing your self-image.

# Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

In Atomic Habits, James Clear emphasizes that the easier a habit is to do, the more likely it is to stick. He introduces practical strategies to reduce friction and make habits more automatic. His perspective can be summarized around the principle: “Make it obvious, make it attractive, 
make it easy, and make it satisfying”—the Four Laws of Behavior Change. Focusing on “making it easy".

1. Reduce friction for good habits -> any resistance or effort that makes a habit harder to start.
2. Increase friction for bad habits -> make unwanted habits harder to do by adding steps or obstacles.
3. Use the “Two-Minute Rule” -> Any habit can be started by scaling it down to just two minutes.
4. Prime your environment -> Make the desired behavior obvious and easy in your environment.
5. Automate when possible -> Use automation or habit stacking to reduce effort.

# Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

In Atomic Habits, James Clear emphasizes that just as making good habits easier helps them stick, making bad habits harder to do helps break them. His perspective is centered on adding friction to undesirable behaviors, so that you naturally do them less often.

1. Increase friction for bad habits -> any obstacle or effort that makes a behavior harder to perform.
2. Use environment design -> Shape your environment so that bad habits are inconvenient or invisible.
3. Introduce “commitment devices” -> Commitment devices are tools or arrangements that make it harder to do a bad habit or impossible to avoid consequences.
4. Make bad habits invisible -> Out of sight, out of mind. The less you see triggers for bad habits, the less likely you are to act on them.
5. Use the inverse of the Two-Minute Rule -> While good habits should start small (under 2 minutes), bad habits should start hard or time-consuming, so there’s a natural deterrent.

# Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

Habit that I would like to do more is Read more books daily.

1. Make the cue obvious:

a. Keep a book on my pillow or desk so I see it regularly.
b. Set a phone reminder at a fixed time, e.g., 9 PM, to read for 15 minutes.
c. Place the book next to my favorite chair or coffee mug to trigger the habit naturally.

2. Make it attractive:

a. Pair reading with something enjoyable, like a cup of tea or coffee.
b. Choose books on topics I’m genuinely curious about.
c. Join a book club or discuss books with friends to make reading social and fun.

3. Make it easy:

a. Start with just 5–10 minutes a day (Two-Minute Rule) to reduce resistance.
b. Keep the book open at the page I last left off so I can start immediately.
c. Use audiobooks for times when I’m commuting or exercising.

4. Make it satisfying:

a. Track each day I read in a habit tracker or journal.
b. Celebrate finishing a chapter or a book with a small reward (like a treat or a short break).
c. Reflect briefly on what I learned or enjoyed, giving a sense of accomplishment.

# Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

Habit that I would like to reduce is scrolling social media aimlessly.

1. Make the cue invisible:

a. Move social media apps off the home screen or uninstall them from my phone.
b. Turn off push notifications so I’m not constantly reminded to check them.

2. Make it unattractive:

a. Remind myself of the negative impact of excessive scrolling.
b. Replace social media with a more appealing activity, like reading or walking, to reduce temptation.

3. Make it hard:

a. Log out of apps after every use so I need to enter my password each time.
b. Keep my phone in another room during work or study time.

4. Make it unsatisfying:

a. Track my time spent on social media and reflect on how much I wasted.
b. Replace the habit with a more satisfying alternative (like journaling or exercising) so the brain associates the new habit with reward.
